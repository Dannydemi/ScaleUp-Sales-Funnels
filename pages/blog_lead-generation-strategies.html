        <h2>Measuring Success and Optimization</h2>

        <p>
          Effective lead generation isn't just about implementing strategies; it's also about continuously measuring their performance and optimizing them. Key metrics to track include conversion rate (the percentage of leads that become customers), cost per lead (the average cost incurred to acquire a single lead), lead quality (assessing the likelihood of a lead converting into a paying customer), and return on investment (the overall profitability of your lead generation efforts).
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          In 2026, a robust lead generation strategy is multifaceted, leveraging a combination of content, SEO, social media, email, and paid advertising.
